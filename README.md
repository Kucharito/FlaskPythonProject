# üí∞ ExpensesProject ‚Äì Flask Expense Tracker

A simple and modular **Flask-based web application** for tracking personal expenses.  
The project is built to demonstrate the structure of a modern Flask app with authentication, database models, and templating.  
It is currently under active development and serves as a foundation for further expansion (e.g., user registration, login system, dashboards, and analytics).

---

## üß± Project Overview

The goal of the project is to provide a lightweight **Expense Tracker** web app where users can:

- Register and log in (via `Flask-Login`)
- Manage personal expenses stored in a local database (SQLite)
- View expenses through a simple dashboard
- Extend functionality easily using Flask blueprints

At the current stage, the core Flask setup is functional ‚Äî the app runs successfully, loads templates, serves static files, and initializes the database.
